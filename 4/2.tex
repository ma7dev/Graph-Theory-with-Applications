\begin{problem}{2: Disjoint Roads.} A number k of trucking companies, $c_1$, . . . , $c_k$...
\end{problem}
\begin{sol}
This problem is a max flow problem. By using Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the result of the algorithm is a set of paths. If the value of the flow is less than k, the algorithm returns false, impossible. The time complexity is $O(Ek)$ as the max flow $|f|<k$.
