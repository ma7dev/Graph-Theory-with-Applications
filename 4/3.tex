\end{problem}
\begin{sol}
This problem is a max flow problem. By using Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the result of the algorithm is a set of food assignments. The maximum number of happy customers means the minimum number of vouchers. The time complexity is $O(mn^2)$ as the number of edges is $E=mn$ and the max flow $|f|\leq n$.
