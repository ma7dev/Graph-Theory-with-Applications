\begin{sol}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Please look at Graph 1 for the residual network $G_f$.
    \item Please look at Graph 1. The path $s->d->b->a->t$ has the maximum flow to push is 2.
    \item Please look at Graph 2 for the updated flow. Please look at Graph 4 for the updated residual network $G_{f'}$.
    \item There isn't any path from $s$ to $t$. The maximum flow is 13.
    \item The residual graph is the same as (c) because the flow from (c) was already the maximum.
    \item Please look at Graph 5 for reference to my answer. The minimum cuts are $(\{s, b, c, d\},\{a, t\})$ and $(\{s, a, b, c, d\},\{t\})$, and the capacity of both of the cuts is equal to the sum of capacities from X region to Y region in both of the suggested minimum cuts, which they have a capacity of 13.
